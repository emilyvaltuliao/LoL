December 2023 Statistics Minor Capstone Project 
Hello. This is my GitHub Repository for my 2023 Statistics Minor Capstone Project: Impact of Player Metrics and Team Strategies on Match Wins. 

Project Overview

This project is my capstone for my statistics minor, completed in December 2023. The focus of this analysis is on competitive League of Legends games from 2020, utilizing statistical methods to extract insights and identify trends within professional play. 

Research Question: What are the specific player performance metrics and team strategies that significantly impact match outcomes in League of Legends, and how do these factors contribute to determining winning teams?


Dataset

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and consists of competitive League of Legends matches played in 2020. The dataset can be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fernandorubiogarcia/2020-league-of-legends-competitive-games/data

Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key trends in professional League of Legends matches.

Apply statistical techniques to identify significant factors influencing match outcomes.

Utilize visualization methods to present findings in an interpretable manner.

Methodology

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values and formatted data for analysis.

Standardized feature names for consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed win rates, objective control, and team metrics.

Used descriptive statistics (significance values, confusion matrices, and AIC values) to summarize data.

Statistical Modeling & Hypothesis Testing

Applied regression analysis to assess relationships between in-game metrics and match outcomes.

Conducted hypothesis tests to determine statistically significant predictors of victory.

Technologies Used

R (dplyr, tidyr, tidyverse, corrplot, ggplot2, caret)

R Studio

Key Findings

Certain player metrics, such as KDA per player, CS for everyone except Jng, damange for Mid, Top, and Jng. 

Team objective metrics such structure objectives, monster objectives, rift herald objectives, elemental drakes, and game length are significant to games won. 


Future Work

Expanding the analysis to include data from multiple years for trend comparison.

Exploring the impact of individual player performances on overall team success.
